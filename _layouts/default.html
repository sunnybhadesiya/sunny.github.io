        About me : 
		Hi !  I'm Sunny Bhadesiya, I am a Cloud Infrastructure Architect working for Sophos Plc. I am a part of the Cloud Infrastructure Service Team here at Ahmedabad, India. </br>
		</br>
		Simplicity in Action ! </br>
 			- I heard somwhere "Learn something once by doing it yourselves, then with some mechanism, you can share that with the rest of the team and then everybody knows how to do it."
		</br>
		
		One interesting thing I would like to write here which is in my remembrance, while I was in college, there was one lecture going on and I heard from one person who provided guidance to students about life which till date I remember is, "Those people who will enjoy in early life - they need to do exercise in later life and those who will do hard work with dedication and perseverance in early life - they will enjoy their life in later time." - This sentence deeply affected me and yes! this is a kind of motivational sentence we can consider.

		Why innovation isn't technology-driven, but culturally-led, A really great article written by amazonian: http://techquarterly.asia/node/92

		Hard Work, Coming out of comfort ZONE.
		Talking about humility:--> Keeping our minds, our hearts & our consciousness, open to learn from the people around us.
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
		Start with the small things - It's hard to hear from people who are equal to you. It's easier in one sense to hear from people who are higher than you, when people are higher, you take them as a person in a place of authority; The HARDEST it to learn from those who are equal. Therefore, Let's start with the smaller THINGS. 
                </br>
                </br>
		Humility - Openness, When you are simply talking, you are only repeating what you know. But when you are listening to others, you are actually learning something new. So, If you want to grow self-confidence is great. 
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
		An Interesting person says, "You always have to find the next wave, and then you have to kind of try to ride it, so get your surfboard and jump on it. It's not easy to spot the next wave, and that wave ended quickly. But there's always new waves. You kind of have to see them coming a bit before, and if you get in early that helps you a lot."

		Just'd a thought while talked to colleague at work about temperature rising levels in a street where we're living, "Why do we expect something from Nature if we are doing nothing for Nature."
